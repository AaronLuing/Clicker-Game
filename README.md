# Lawnmower Man

Lawnmower man is my attempt at taking one of my very first programming challenges, a simple clicker game, and rewriting the code to make 
it cleaner and more efficient.  The entire project is written in HTML and Javascript, with a CSS file to make it look better and add some
basic animations.
